    <p>Hi,</p>

    <p>
      I'm a student here at UW–Madison, and my roommates and I recently built a
      platform called
      <span class="highlight">LeaseLink</span> to help make subleasing way
      easier for students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why? Because we got fed up jumping between 10 different Facebook groups
      just to find a subletter — and we realized a ton of other students were
      doing the exact same thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're doing a super quick survey (literally ~1 minute) to better
      understand how students like you find housing or sublets around Madison.
    </p>

      <span class="emoji">🎁</span> As a thank you, we're raffling off a
      <span class="highlight">$25 gift card</span> to a random respondent!
    </p>

    <p>
      Appreciate you helping us build something better for Badgers

      Let me know if you've ever subleased before — we'd love to chat.
